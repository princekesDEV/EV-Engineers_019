## design decisions or assumptions

# Responsive Design First
Design Decision: Adopted a mobile-first approach to ensure the website is fully responsive and functions smoothly on all device sizes (mobile, tablet, and desktop).

Assumption: Majority of users will access the site via mobile devices, so the design prioritizes mobile usability without compromising the desktop experience.

# Minimal JavaScript for Core Functionality
Design Decision: Utilized JavaScript only where necessary to enhance the interactivity of the site, such as enabling search, filtering, and dropdown menus, while keeping the overall codebase lightweight.

Assumption: Users prefer fast load times and simple interactivity over complex animations or heavy use of JavaScript, particularly for e-commerce websites.

# Static Frontend Without Backend Integration
Design Decision: Developed the website as a static frontend project with no backend integration. All product data and functionality (e.g., product listing, cart operations) are hardcoded.

Assumption: The website is intended as a front-end prototype for showcasing design and UI/UX, assuming that dynamic features and database integration could be added later if needed.
# Intuitive Navigation and User Flow
Design Decision: Created a minimalistic and easy-to-navigate layout, allowing users to find products and essential features (e.g., cart, search) without confusion.

Assumption: Users expect a straightforward interface where navigation is intuitive and requires minimal clicks to reach their desired actions.

# Consistent Branding and Visual Identity
Design Decision: Followed a consistent visual theme with a clean, modern design using complementary colors, typography, and imagery suited to the beauty and wellness industry.

Assumption: A polished and aesthetically appealing website will increase user engagement and build trust, aligning with users’ expectations of high-quality e-commerce brands.

# Static Product Data for Demonstration
Design Decision: Chose to hardcode product information and interactions for simplicity in this version of the project.

Assumption: This design is suitable for demonstration purposes, assuming users will focus on the layout and interface rather than expecting real-time dynamic product data.
